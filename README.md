# Chicago_Resources_Analysis

This is a GIS notebook to show some of the basic correlations between Chicago communities and resources in said communities. The goal to see if particular resources/lack of resources may correlate with an area's crime rate, poverty rate, etc.

This is an exercise to develop data analysis/cleaning, machine learning, and GIS skills, along with a case study on urban communities in America.
